## Definitions
**Inheritance:** 
- The mechanism in Java by which one class acquires the properties (instance variables) and functionalities of another class is known as Inheritance.
  - Base Class/Superclass: The base class is the main class where a derived class inherits the feature. 
    It is also known as the superclass or parent class.
  - Derived class/Sub-class: Derived class is a class that inherits from a base class. 
    It is also known as subclass or child class.
  - User-defined Example in Automation: we create a Base Class in the Automation Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, waits, loggers, reports, property files, Excels, etc.
  - We can extend the Base Class in other classes, by doing this we can reuse the code of existing super class.
